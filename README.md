Reading notes:

-.java is a class extention
-A class holds one or more methods for instructions on how you want it to function and must be declared with curly braces
-java has 3 looping constructs: while, do-while and for
-a class is a blueprint for an object
-each object made from that class can have its own values for the imstance variables of that class
-an object is like a entry or detail for the template you created
-the dot operator "." gives you access to an objects state and behavior (instance variables and methods)
   Example: Dog d = new Dog(); (object)
   d.bark(); (dot variable is used on variable d to call back4)
   d.size = 40; (set its size using dot operator)
-varibles come in 2 flavors: primitive and reference
-a variable is just a container to hold or store something
-Arrays are like a tray of cups and are great for when you want a quick ordered and efficient list of things.
-Arrays are always objects,whether theyre declared to hold primitives or object references
-the array object can have elements which are primitives, but the array its self is never a primitive 
-every insatnce of a particular class has gthe same methods, but the methods can behave differently based on the value of the instance variables
-all methods have a return type, until you "void" it out and it wont give anything back
-methods can have multiple parameters, seperate them with commas when you declare them, and seperate the arguments with commas when you pass them.
-if a method has parameters you MUST pass arguments of the right type and order
